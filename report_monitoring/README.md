# Task Report: Configuring Ingress, Alerts, and Kubecost in Kubernetes üöÄ

## Step 1: Modify Helm Code for Ingress üõ†Ô∏è

### Description
- The Ingress configuration was updated to route HTTP/HTTPS requests to Prometheus and Grafana services using the NGINX Ingress Controller.
- TLS certification was enabled using cert-manager with Let's Encrypt for secure connections.

### Kubecost Ingress
- Configured Ingress for the Kubecost service.
- Enabled TLS and basic authentication via the `kubecost-basic-auth` secret.

## Step 2: Install Prometheus and Grafana üìà

### Description
- Prometheus and Grafana were deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.
- Ingress configurations for both services were applied with HTTPS enabled.

### Next Steps
- After deployment, the next step was to set up alerts in Prometheus.

## Step 3: Configure Prometheus Alerts ‚ö†Ô∏è

### File Creation
- A separate file `alerts.yaml` was created to define custom Prometheus rules.

### Alert Rules
1. **HighCPUUsage**:
   - Triggered when the CPU usage of containers matching `myapp-.*` exceeds 70% for more than 1 minute.
   - Provides a summary and a description with the current metric value.

2. **HighMemoryUsage**:
   - Triggered when memory usage of the same containers exceeds 70% of 1.5GB for more than 1 minute.
   - Includes annotations for summary and description with the current metric value.

## Step 4: Test Alerts üß™

### Cluster Load Test
- The cluster was intentionally loaded to validate if the alerts function as expected.

### Grafana Integration
- Verified that Grafana dashboards correctly displayed the alerts and provided detailed insights.

## Step 6: Install and Configure Kubecost üí∞

### Installation
- Kubecost was installed in the Kubernetes cluster with the previously configured Ingress.
